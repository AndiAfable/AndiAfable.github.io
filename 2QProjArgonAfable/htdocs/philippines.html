		<h3>Philippines</h3>
		
		<p>Because of an unprepared healthcare system as well as an incompetent government, the Philippines 
		has now become the country with the most reported cases. This is not good but this fate was easily 
		predictable.</p>
		
		<p>The government’s poor managing of funds meant that there were not enough medical supplies to go 
		around and that research for a vaccine would be slow. They have also neglected mass testing which 
		means many could spread the disease without knowledge of it. By means of social distancing and wearing 
		masks, the regulations have not been tight. People wear masks improperly and go out all the time and no 
		punishment is given.</p>
				
		<p>That is why as of December 11, 2020, according to Google, the Philippines has had around 446,000 COVID-19 
		cases of which 409,000 have recovered and 8,701 have died.  We have truly come a long way since the 
		epidemic first started.  But that doesn’t mean that we’ve done super good.  As you may or may not 
		have seen from the Status of Asia page, we are far from amazing at handling the pandemic.  
		Let’s  get a better insight on why.</p>
	
		<p>Firstly, we do not have the space needed to take in all incoming patients.  Not enough beds are being 
		allotted to take care of everyone so not all the infected people can be treated right away.  Every region 
		in the country has at least a mild shortage and major regions like NCR are at the most shortage.  This is 
		bad especially for those in critical condition as urgent care cannot be given.</p>
	
		<p>Secondly, the number of medical staff is also way under the WHO’s recommended ratio of patients to staff.  
		The average was said by UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team to be 3.7 doctors per 10,000 population.  This is 
		very low compared to the recommended ratio of 1 doctor per 1,000 patients.</p>
	
		<p>Thirdly, the personal protective equipment or PPE that civilians and medical professionals alike need are 
		also in shortage.  Some people have to resort to making their own “D.I.Y” masks, face shields, and  hazmat suits.  
		These homemade versions of desperately needed PPE are not only more prone to have holes or be ill fitting but 
		they may also not protect the wearer as much as the real product because the material isn’t medical grade.  
		This also contributes a bit to people getting sick.</p>
	
		<p>But it’s not all the medical world’s fault.  The rest of society has a hand in this too.  Let’s start with 
		the common people.  Anyone within the ages of 15-65 can tell you, a lot of people don’t seem to get what we’re 
		all supposed to be doing with the COVID prevention situation.  They put comfort over common sense sometimes.  
		They’ve all seen it, the ones that remove their mask to talk, only cover their mouths, cannot obey social distancing, 
		and don’t forget the ones who throw parties in the middle of a pandemic.  Not much new research is needed to prove 
		that these are the reasons people get sick in the first place.  The math is simple.  More people outside = more cases.</p>
	
		<p>Yes, us citizens take a part of the blame but what about these influential people (politicians, celebrities, 
		etc.) having large gatherings and having everyone get sick?  Do they have no hand in this?  It’s laughable how 
		they can go party but if we violate the rules, we get killed.</p>
	
		<p>What we can see here is that there truly are people who are trying their best just to get through these tough times 
		but alas, we are imperfect in resources, discipline, and intelligence.</p>
