		<h3>Taiwan</h3>
		
		<p>This county has done a phenomenal job at keeping the virus at bay. They have an extremely low 
		number of cases and even lesser deaths.</p>
		
		<p>The people and the government have really been in sync when it comes to this pandemic. Everyone 
		takes it seriously. Mass testing and the provision of supplies to those in need has been top priority 
		for people in Taiwan. They’ve made all stops possible in protecting themselves and others from the virus. 
		his country is truly doing something right.  Let us see how they pulled it off.</p>
		
		<p>As of December 12, 2020, according to Google, Taiwan has had 724 COVID-19 cases of which 590 
		have recovered and 7 have died.  Out of the three countries on this page, Taiwan, by a landslide 
		victory, takes the crown for the best reactions from the people and lowest case count.  The other 
		two countries have their cases and deaths somewhere in the thousands while the total number of 
		cases to ever happen in Taiwan doesn’t exceed 750. It doesn’t even exceed 725. This is truly 
		astonishing.</p>
		
		<p>But how did they accomplish this?  It started way back when the first few cases were announced.  
		Taiwan’s government from the start, banned people coming from Wuhan, China where cases were appearing.  
		This made them the first country to ban travel from Wuhan.  The ban was also applied to other 
		countries in the later months.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, even with the bans, someone who was infected slipped through the cracks and cases 
		in Taiwan started to spread.  There was no need to fear, however.  Taiwan had the Central Epidemic Command 
		Center or CECC which successfully handled SARS back in 2003.  They had faced a similar enemy before so 
		they were prepared.  Also, unlike other countries, this one didn’t have a shortage of beds in hospitals.  
		This means that the infected were able to get the treatment they needed right away.</p>
		
		<p>Taiwanese researchers even took it one step further and developed a test kit in a short amount of time.  
		This made testing easier and more efficient.  Aside from that, they had many laboratories spread across 
		the country that could perform 3,900 tests daily.  The only downside to this is that medical staff had to 
		be overworked to do this.</p>
		
		<p>This is all fine and dandy but let’s state even more reasons why Taiwan handled this pandemic so well.  
		Besides what was already mentioned, Taiwan is a leader in face mask manufacturing so making them and getting 
		them to people wasn’t an issue.  People also generally followed all social rules when outside, making things 
		a lot easier than it already is.  Actually, in June of this year, Taiwan was actually loosening its social 
		distancing and number of people per space rules since they don’t get many cases.</p>
