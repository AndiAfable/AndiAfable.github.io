	<h3>Asia as a whole</h3>
	<p>The continent as a whole is trying to redeem itself after COVID brought a few setbacks.  
	   Many countries in the continent, while still having cases, are no longer at a rate that 
	   is concerning.  This has allowed them to slowly reopen the economy.</p>
	
	<p>This is not the case for all countries though.  Many, due to underdeveloped medical systems,
	   still struggle with keeping the curve flat.</p>
	<br>
	
	<!--Philippines page introduction-->
	<h3>Philippines</h3>
	<p>Because of an unprepared healthcare system as well as an incompetent government, the 
	   Philippines has now become the country with the most reported cases.  This is not good but 
	   this fate was easily predictable.</p>
	   
	 <p>The government’s poor managing of funds meant that there were not enough medical supplies
    	to go around and that research for a vaccine would be slow.  They have also neglected mass 
		testing which means many could spread the disease without knowledge of it.  By means of social 
		distancing and wearing masks, the regulations have not been tight.  People wear masks improperly 
		and go out all the time and no punishment is given.</p>

	<!--China page introduction-->
	<h3>China</h3>
	<p>China, the origin of the virus, is one of the countries who have taken control over the pandemic.
   	   Their rapid response to the virus ensured that it was eliminated as soon as possible.</p>
	   
	<p>People have basically gone back to normal life.  People are going to gatherings again, public places 
	   are crowded shoulder to shoulder, and not many wear masks.  This is astonishing as it was only a few 
	   months ago that this virus wreaked havoc on the country.  The shift in behavior is drastic and if the 
	   people are not careful, another wave of cases could emerge.</p>

	<!--Taiwan page introduction-->
	<h3>Taiwan</h3>
	<p>This county has done a phenomenal job at keeping the virus at bay.  They have an extremely 
	   low number of cases and even lesser deaths.</p>
	   
	<p>The people and the government have really been in sync when it comes to this pandemic.  Everyone takes 
	   it seriously.  Mass testing and the provision of supplies to those in need has been top priority for 
	   people in Taiwan.  They’ve made all stops possible in protecting themselves and others from the virus.  
	   This country is truly doing something right.</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>When compared to China and Taiwan, the Philippines does not stack up.  The Philippines 
		is not prepared to cope with any of the negative effects of COVID-19.  People are losing 
		their jobs, getting sick, and dying left and right.  Both the people and the government have 
		failed to do their part properly and so this is why I (a Filipino) am still stuck in quarantine 
		while others go back to school.</p>
