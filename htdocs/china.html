		<h3>China</h3>
		<p>China, the origin of the virus, is one of the countries who have taken control over the pandemic. 
		Their rapid response to the virus ensured that it was eliminated as soon as possible.</p>
		
		<p>People have basically gone back to normal life. People are going to gatherings again, public places 
		are crowded shoulder to shoulder, and not many wear masks. This is astonishing as it was only a few months 
		ago that this virus wreaked havoc on the country. The shift in behavior is drastic and if the people are 
		not careful, another wave of cases could emerge.  Let us discuss this further.</p>
		
		<p>As of December 11, 2020, according to Google, China has had around 86,688 COVID-19 cases 
		of which 81,762 have recovered and 4,634 have died.  The country, being the birthplace of this 
		virus has done a good job at keeping it at bay.  After all, their cases have been at an all 
		time low for most of this time.  But before we get into their implementation of policies and 
		all that, let’s take a short history lesson on the virus.</p>
		
		<p>This virus is thought to originally be from Wuhan, China.  The first cases were traced 
		back to a market in that area and those who were infected were shopkeepers or shoppers from that 
		market.  Since hospital staff had not seen this virus before, it was reported to the WHO on December 
		31, 2019.  The virus was identified a few days later and its DNA sequence was shared on January 11.  
		This would prove very useful as the rush to make a vaccine increases.</p>
		
		<p>So we’ve heard about the history and such so let’s get back to the nitty gritty.  We’ve seen that 
		China has kept excellent control on the number of cases almost since the start of the pandemic.  
		Everyone has seemed to pull themselves together to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
		
		<p>The first evidence to support that claim comes from China’s response to the pandemic.  From the 
		get-go, they started building hospitals and making room in existing ones for the eventual COVID-19 
		patients to use.  They’ve had experience with a pandemic like this before and this time, they knew 
		how to prepare.  In terms of space, China had plenty.</p>
		
		<p>What about staff?  You can’t run a hospital without staff.  Well, China deployed 40,000 new staff
		to help fight off the virus.  All of this happened within the first two months of the outbreak as China 
		wanted to keep cases to a minimum.</p>
		
		<p>Also, when it came to personal protective equipment or PPE, China had a shortage just like everybody 
		else.  The government acted fast though and slowly, the needs of the people were met.</p>
		
		<p>When it came to the medical side of things, China handled it very well.  Let us now see how the common 
		people did during this time.</p>
		
		<p>A lockdown was implemented on January 24, 2020, just a day before a major Chinese festival where many 
		people would have gathered.  The lockdown was stricter and more serious than anyone has seen before and 
		experts were skeptical if the lockdown would even help anything.  Many establishments were closed down 
		except ones that provided food and medicine.  Public transport was closed.  School was cancelled very early 
		on so that the rise of cases wouldn’t be as great and easier to handle.</p>
		
		<p>The medical staff and the government seemed to have done great but what about the citizens.  Well, cases 
		wouldn’t be so low if it weren’t for the public also stepping up.  People were compliant with social 
		distancing, wearing their masks, and staying inside.  They disciplined themselves enough that, combined with 
		the other actions stated above, they beat corona.</p>
